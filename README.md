Begin with the file called ALLnMDSAphaenoCHCs. This file contains data on how to process and examine your CHC mastersheet that contains your retention times and areas. After the data has been processed you can create non-metric multiple dimension sclaing diagrams with this file.

AllIdicatorAnalysisAphaenoCHCs. This file will determine which particular CHCs are driving the differences between your variables.

AllPermanovaAphaenoCHCs. This file with perform betadiveristy analysis using Permanovas (since this data is non-paremetric)

AlphaDiversityAphaenoCHCs. This file will perfrom Shannon diveristy, richness and evenness alphadiversity analysis using non-parametic tests.

PCAAphaenoCHCs. This file will allow you to perfom a PCA analysis to exmaine what dives the differences you exmain in your data.

HydrocarbonClassBarchartsAphaenoCHCs. This file will allow you to make bar charts. I specifically used this to make barcharts showcasing the different CHC classes in each of my sample species.
